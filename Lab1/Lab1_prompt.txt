CS 0401 Lab 01: Welcome to the Lab

Note: If you do not complete the lab this week you may finish it 
between lab meetings and demonstrate it to your TA at the beginning of 
next week lab.

1. Introduction

	CS-0401 laboratory activities are created to reinforce the concepts 
	that you have been learning in the class lectures. In each laboratory 
	you will get an activity which has its goals. After developing your Java program that 
	performs what has been asked, you must show your program outputs to get your grade.
	
	In this lab the following topics will be covered:
	- Getting the lab assignment
	- Creating new projects in a text editor and also in NetBeans IDE
	- Running/Testing your code in a command window and also inside NetBeans
	- Showing your work in to the lab TA
	
2. Getting the Lab Assignments 

	If you are using a paper copy of this assignment and you are wondering where to get 
	this and any future lab assignments for this course, they can be found at the 
	following URL: http://paulobrasko.com/cs-0401-fall-2016-pitt/lab-schedule
	
3. Required IDE to Develop Your Programs
	
	You should always take advantage of the great features that an Integrated Development 
	Environment (IDE) application offers. Within an IDE, you can edit your source code, 
	compile, run, debug, get hints on what imports are required, get errors and warning 
	messages, get on-the-spot java documentation of the classes and their methods, 
	and much more.
	
	There are many IDEs out there, but to help the TA and the Instructor when discussing 
	bugs in your code, etc., you are being requested to use NetBeans. All the lab 
	computers should have NetBeans installed. If you want to install it in your own 
	computer and need help in doing so, you can watch Video #01: “How to Install Netbeans 
	and Java in your Computer” in my video library.

	Even though you will be using Netbeans IDE for developing and running your programs 
	in this course, you, as a programmer must also have a knowledge on how you would 
	manually compile and run your code in a terminal window. In this lab you will perform 
	both tasks.
	
4. CS 0401 Code Samples

	During this course, we will go over many Java code samples. These code samples are 
	specific for a given topic discussed in the class. When studying the lines inside a 
	java file pay attention on the statements and read all the comments. Lots of 
	information have been placed there to facilitate your learning experience. The code 
	samples come from two different places: a set of the code samples comes from the 
	Textbook Editor’s website, and the other set comes from Prof. Dr. Ramirez 
	(see “Credits” at the bottom of the main webpage of my site). Both of them can be 
	found in the Course Handouts page.

5. Creating and Running Your First Java Program

	This lab is divided into two activities: in the first activity you will learn how to 
	copy a sample code, compile, and run it using  the command/terminal window and a 
	regular text editor of your preference. In the second activity you will learn how to 
	do the same thing within NetBeans IDE.
	
	5.1 Creating a Program Without an IDE
	
		In this activity you will copy the Ex01.java code from my handouts page 
		(Course Handouts) into your local drive, and manually compile and run it by 
		typing Java commands in a terminal window.
		
		To get familiarized with the procedure that you are about to execute, please 
		watch the following videos:
		- Video #3: "Compiling and Running Java in a Terminal Window"
		- Video #5: "Working with the CS 0401 Sample Codes from within a Command Window"
		
		Now do it yourself:
		1.) Open Ex1.java sample code by clicking its link on the syllabus or handouts
			page and saved it into your local directory.
		2.) Open a terminal window and change the directory to wherever place you saved
			Ex1.java
		3.) Comple the code using "javac" command
		4.) Run Ex1 program by using "java" command 
		
		You should get the following message printed out in the terminal window:
			"Java is Awesome by a factor of 10"
		If you get stuck, as the lab TA to help you. 
		
	5.2 Using Netbeans IDE
	
		To start this activity, watch video #2: A Simple Java Program at:
		http://www.paulobrasko.com/cs-0401-fall-2016-pitt/course-material/videos/netbeans-videos/
		
		After watching it, do the following:
		1.) Create a new Java Project in Netbeans under the name Ex01
		2.) Copy and paste the EX01.java file contents into your project
		3.) Run your project. You should get the same results in the Netbeans output 
			screen as you got in Section 5.1 
			
6. Grading
	
	Once you have completed and self-tested your program, you should demonstrate it to 
	your Lab TA. There will be 4 raw points for this lab, broken down in the following 
	way:
	- Show that you have learned how to compile your program and it is compiling without
	error (2 points)
	- Show that you have learned how to run your program and it prints out the expected
	message on the terminal window (2 points)
	The 4 raw points will be normalized to give this lab equal weight to the other labs in
	the CS 0401 course. 
	
7. Challenge Yourself 

	Because this is the first lab, there will be no challenge item to the done. 
	
8. Nots and Hints

	If you need help as you are working on the program, ask your TA. If you do not finish
	this program during your lab session, you will be given the opportunity to demonstrate
	it to your TA at the beginning of next week's lab. However, you will be not allowed to
	work on this lab during your next lab session, so if you do not finish it during this
	session, be sure to finish it during the week between session. Seek help from your TA
	or course instructor if necessary.
